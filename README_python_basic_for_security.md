## ⚙️ What’s Inside

- Basics of Python syntax: variables, loops, functions  
- Working with strings/files and handling input/output  
- Simple scripts relevant to security (parsing logs, simple encryption, etc.)  
- Practical exercises to reinforce learning  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Prerequisites

Make sure your setup includes:

- Python 3.x  
- A code editor or IDE (VSCode, PyCharm, etc.)  
- Basic terminal/command-line understanding  
- Optional: virtual environment to isolate dependencies

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Michael-Obs66/Python.git
   cd Python/fundamental/python_basic_for_security
   ```

2. Explore script files and examples. Each script usually has a comment at the top explaining its purpose.  

3. Run sample scripts:
   ```bash
   python3 example_script.py
   ```

4. Try the exercises: modify them, extend them, break them — all part of learning!

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

After working through this module, you should be able to:

- Write Python code comfortably (variables, loops, functions)  
- Read and parse files (e.g. logs, text)  
- Handle string manipulation relevant to security tasks  
- Write small utility scripts (e.g. automated checks or filters)  

---

## ⚠️ Tips & Good Practices

- Always test your scripts with safe / sample data before real use  
- Add clear comments and docstrings in scripts  
- Keep security in mind: avoid hard-coding secrets; validate user input  
- Use version control (git) to track your progress
